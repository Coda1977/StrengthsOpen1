# Vercel Postgres vs External Database Analysis

## 🤔 Your Excellent Question: Why Not Vercel Postgres?

You're absolutely right! If we're deploying to Vercel, using Vercel Postgres makes perfect sense. Let me explain the trade-offs:

1. **Create Vercel Project**
   - Import from GitHub
   - Configure build settings
   - Set environment variables (except DATABASE_URL)

2. **Add Database**

   - Choose PostgreSQL
   - Name: `strengthsopen-db`
   - Vercel automatically adds DATABASE_URL to your environment

3. **Deploy & Migrate**
   - App redeploys automatically with database
   - Run migrations: `npm run db:push`
   - Create admin user: `npm run db:fix-admin`
